## Session History

### Session: January 9, 2025 (Session 1)
**Duration**: Initial Documentation Review & Setup
**Phase**: Pre-Phase 1
**Completed**:
- âœ… Reviewed all specification documents in src/
- âœ… Analyzed implementation strategy
- âœ… Created progress tracking system (IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md, SESSION_NOTES.md)
- âœ… Enhanced CLAUDE.md with documentation references and guidelines
- âœ… Established session logging protocol

**Key Decisions**:
- Use specification documents as single source of truth
- Implement multi-tenant isolation from day one
- Follow API Contract Master exactly
- Maintain strict test coverage requirements
- Document all architectural decisions

### Session: January 9, 2025 (Session 2)
**Duration**: Agent System Enhancement
**Phase**: Pre-Phase 1
**Completed**:
- âœ… Analyzed gaps in agent coverage (31 â†’ 39 agents)
- âœ… Created 8 new specialized agents:
  - High Priority: @real-estate-inventory, @crm-leads-pipeline, @redis-caching-queue
  - Soon Priority: @monitoring-observability, @digital-ocean-deployment
  - As Needed: @infobip-sms-whatsapp, @campaign-marketing, @voip-telemarketing
- âœ… Updated AGENTS.md (now 39 agents in 12 categories)
- âœ… Cleaned up outdated documentation (removed old IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- âœ… Enhanced primer.md command for better context loading

**Agent System Enhancements**:
- Added Business Domain category (Real Estate, CRM)
- Added Telemarketing category (VOIP/PBX)
- Expanded Communication (1 â†’ 3 agents)
- Expanded Performance & Operations (2 â†’ 3 agents)
- Expanded DevOps & Documentation (2 â†’ 3 agents)
- Achieved 100% coverage of all specification requirements

**Next Priorities**:
1. Set up PostgreSQL database with Docker
2. Initialize Prisma ORM
3. Implement tenant schema from Database_Schema_Master.md
4. Begin JWT authentication system
